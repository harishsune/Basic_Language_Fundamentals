Constructor in c#

Constructor is a member function which automatically gets executed when the object of the class is created.
Constructors are use to initialized private data member of the class.


Constructor has same name like class name.
Constructor can be overloaded.
Constructor cannot be overridden.
Constructor cannot be inherited.
Constructor cannot be abstract.
Constructor cannot be sealed.


Types of constructor-
Default constructor -
	 Every class provides this constructor only when you don't define any other parameterized constructor in the class.
if you include any parameterized constructor then you explicitly need to define a default constructor.

Parameterized constructor-
	When you want to pass arguments to the constructor the parameterized constructor is used.

Static constructor-
  Static constructor is same like static block in Java. 
  Static constructor is use to initialize static member of a class.
  If your class contain main method and even if you don't create object of the class your static constructor will get executed.
