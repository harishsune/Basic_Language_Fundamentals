Constants are the value that do not change throughout the program.

An enumeration is a set of named integer constants. An enumerated type is declared using the enum keyword.

C# enumerations are value data type.
For enum you can use only number datatypes for eg. int,short,ushort,uint but not string and object.
By default the enum use int but in case if you want to specify then you need to write : in front of enum variable;

eg. enum Temp:short
{
//Values

}
