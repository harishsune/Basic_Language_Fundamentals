Dynamic Polymorphism also called as late binding and Run time Polymorphism

An override method provides a new implementation of a member that is inherited from a base class. The method that is 
overridden by an override declaration is known as the overridden base method. The overridden base method must have the same 
signature as the override method. 

An overriding property declaration must specify exactly the same access modifier, type, and name as the inherited property, 
and the overridden property must be virtual, abstract, or override.

In this run time polymorphism or method overriding we can override a method in base class by creating similar function in 
derived class this can be achieved by using inheritance principle and using “virtual & override” keywords.

In base class if we declare methods with virtual keyword then only we can override those methods in derived class using 
override keyword
