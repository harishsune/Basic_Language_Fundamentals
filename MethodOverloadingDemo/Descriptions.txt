Static Polymorphism also called as early binding and Compile time Polymorphism

The mechanism of linking a function with an object during compile time is called early binding. It is also called static 
binding. C# provides two techniques to implement static polymorphism. These are:

Function overloading

Operator overloading

You can have multiple definitions for the same function name in the same scope. The definition of the function must differ 
from each other by the types and/or the number of arguments in the argument list. You cannot overload function declarations 
 differ only by return type.
