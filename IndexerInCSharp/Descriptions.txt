An indexer allows an object to be indexed like an array. When you define an indexer for a class, this class behaves like a 
virtual array. You can then access the instance of this class using the array access operator ([ ]).

Syntax
A one dimensional indexer has the following syntax:

element-type this[int index] 
{
   // The get accessor.
   get 
   {
      // return the value specified by index 
   }

   // The set accessor.
   set 
   {
      // set the value specified by index 
   }
}
Use of Indexers
Declaration of behavior of an indexer is to some extent similar to a property. Like properties, you use get and set accessors 
for defining an indexer. However, properties return or set a specific data member, whereas indexers returns or sets a 
particular value from the object instance. In other words, it breaks the instance data into smaller parts and indexes each 
part, gets or sets each part.

Defining a property involves providing a property name. Indexers are not defined with names, but with the this keyword, which 
refers to the object instance.
