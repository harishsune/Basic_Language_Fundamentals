Inheritance allows you derive public,protected members of class to another. It is use to provide re usability of code.

In c# ":" symbol is use to make inheritance between two class.
Inheritance level depend upon the access modifiers used in class.

Access modifiers are keywords used to specify the declared accessibility of a member or a type. This section introduces the four access modifiers:
public
protected
internal
private
The following five accessibility levels can be specified using the access modifiers:
public : Access is not restricted.
protected : Access is limited to the containing class or types derived from the containing class.
Internal : Access is limited to the current assembly.
protected internal: Access is limited to the current assembly or types derived from the containing class.
private : Access is limited to the containing type.

Multiple inheritance is not possible in c#.

You can inherit multiple Interfaces in single class.
