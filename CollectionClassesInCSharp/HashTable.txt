2.HashTable

The Hashtable class represents a collection of key-and-value pairs that are organized based on the hash code of the key. It 
uses the key to access the elements in the collection.

A hash table is used when you need to access elements by using key, and you can identify a useful key value. Each item in 
the hash table has a key/value pair. The key is used to access the items in the collection.
