The keyword static means only one copy will provided throughout the program.

Static Class-


In C# class can be declared as static. You cannot create object of this class.
All the member variables and methods should be static.
Public member and method can be directly access by using the class name.
Static class cannot be inherited. and cannot inherit any other class or interface.

Static Variables-

Static Variables can be part of normal methods. But normal variables and methods cannot be part of static methods.

Static Methods-

Static Methods can access only static members of class.

Static Constructor-

A normal class can have static constructor as well as normal constructor.
But Static class must have static constructor only.


If u written static constructor in a normal class and u have Main() method in same class then your static constructor will
always get calls even if you don't create object of that class.
