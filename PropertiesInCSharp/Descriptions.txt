Properties are named members of classes, structures, and interfaces. Member variables or methods in a class or structures 
are called Fields. Properties are an extension of fields and are accessed using the same syntax. They use accessors through 
which the values of the private fields can be read, written or manipulated.

Properties do not name the storage locations. Instead, they have accessors that read, write, or compute their values.

For example, let us have a class named Student, with private fields for age, name and code. We cannot directly access these
 fields from outside the class scope, but we can have properties for accessing these private fields.

Accessors
The accessor of a property contains the executable statements that helps in getting (reading or computing) or setting 
(writing) the property. The accessor declarations can contain a get accessor, a set accessor, or both.
